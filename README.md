# Produce App 

I wanted to make a produce subscription app, kind of like Imperfect Foods. 

## Home Page

# Unresolved challenges:
- I wanted to add my own icons to the items but couldn't figure out how. I tried for hours and decided to just leave it as is for time sake.
- I also wanted to add a string that would tell you what produce was in season. I added it as a string with a required of true but that didn't seem to work. I'm pretty sure that is the way to do it, I need to go back and work on it.

# Stretch goals
- I want to have the login page fade into the next page.
- I also want to create a dark mode, with the theme remaining similiar but not as bright.
